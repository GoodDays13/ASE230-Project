# Public Square

This project is a social media platform that challenges modern social media design by presenting all content in a single, unfiltered chronological feed. Unlike conventional platforms that use algorithms and filters to curate content, this application forces users to engage with all posts in the order they were created—eliminating echo chambers and unavoidable exposure to diverse perspectives. The platform is built using PHP and flat-file storage (JSON), with plans to migrate to MySQL later in the semester. Users can register accounts, authenticate through a secure login system, and create posts that appear in the shared global feed. The application implements role-based permissions with 'user' and 'admin' levels, where administrators access a dedicated panel to search, edit, and delete users or posts as needed. All entities support full CRUD operations managed through flat files. The interface uses Bootstrap's default theme for responsive design across devices. This prototype demonstrates core CMS functionality while exploring an alternative approach to social media that prioritizes transparency and unfiltered discourse over personalized content curation.
